# Riftbound Deck Builder - User Guide

Welcome to the **Riftbound Deck Builder**, a new tool for forging your decks. This guide will walk you through the core features of the platform.

## 1. Getting Started

### Registration & Login

To start creating and saving your own decks, you need to create an account:

- **Register**: Click on the "Register" link in the navigation bar to create a new account.
- **Login**: Use your credentials to access your personal collection.

### Exploring Decks

The **Home Page** showcases the latest decks created by the community. You can click on any deck card to view its full composition, including its identity, strategy, and card breakdown.

---

## 2. Managing Your Collection

### My Decks

Once logged in, the **"My Decks"** section is your personal hub. Here you can:

- View all the decks you've created.
- See a quick summary of each deck.
- Access the **Deck Forge** to create a brand-new deck from scratch.

### Creating a Deck

Click the **"Create Deck"** button in the navigation bar, the header from the **Home page** or the "My Collection" header to initialize a new deck. You will be automatically redirected to the **Deck Editor**.

## 3. Using the Deck Editor (The Forge)

The editor is divided into two main sections: the **Card Catalog** (left) and the **Deck Manager** (right).

### Building Logic

The editor follows an "Intelligent Flow" to help you build valid decks:

1.  **Identity (Legend)**: Start by picking your Legend. You can only have one.
2.  **Battlefields**: Select exactly 3 Battlefields to define where your combat takes place.
3.  **Main Deck**: Add Units, Spells, Gear, and Champions (exactly 40 cards).
4.  **Runes**: Select up to 12 Runes to empower your strategy.

### Filtering and Searching

Use the **Filter Bar** to find exactly what you need:

- **Search**: Type card names or text.
- **Domains**: Filter by elemental domains (Fury, Mind, Calm...).
- **Sections** (deck manager from the right): Quickly switch between Legend, Battlefield, Main Deck, Runes, and Sideboard views.
- **Smart Auto-Advance**: The editor will automatically switch sections as you complete the requirements (e.g., after picking 3 Battlefields, it switches to the Main Deck).

### Sideboard

If you want to prepare for specific matchups, use the **Sideboard** section to store up to 8 additional cards (Units, Spells, Gear, Champions or Runes).

## 4. Deck Viewing and Sharing

### Public View

When viewing a deck (your own or someone else's):

- **Identity Showcase**: See the Legend and Main Champion at a glance.
- **Visual Modes**: Toggle between **Grid View** (to see card art) and **List View** (for a compact summary).
- **Sorting**: Sort cards by Name, Energy cost, Rarity, or Type.
- **Details**: Right-Click on any card to see its full stats, tags, and abilities. Left click for list view.

### Permissions

- **Edit**: You can only edit decks that you have created. If you are viewing someone else's deck, the "Edit" button will be hidden.
- **Share**: Use the "Share" button to copy the URL and show your creation to others.

---

## 5. Game Rules & Validations

The Forge automatically enforces core Riftbound rules:

- **Copy Limit**: Max 1 copy of any Legend/Battlefield. Max 3 copies of any other card.
- **Deck Size**: The editor will warn you if your main deck is full (40 cards) or your sideboard is full (8 cards).
